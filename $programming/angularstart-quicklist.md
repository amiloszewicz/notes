### [Lesson 2: Getting Started](#lesson-2-getting-started)

#### Getting Started

There are a few things that we will do at the beginning of every application build, these are things like:

- Generating the application
- Installing extra packages (if necessary)
- Restructuring the generated application to our liking

### [Lesson 3: The Architecture](#lesson-3-the-architecture)

The application will be broken up into two main parts:

- Viewing all checklists
- Interacting with individual checklists

These features will be represented by the two routed/smart components in our application:

- home (for viewing all checklists)
- checklist

Home & checklist are a *feature* and they will contain most of the code.

feature (omitted in this case because we have just one smart component per feature)
data-access
ui
utils
For example, our checklist feature will contain the following:

data-access: checklist-item.service.ts
ui: checklist-item-header and checklist-item-list (dumb components)
There will also be some shared functionality that we will store in a shared folder:

data-access: checklist.service and storage.service
interfaces: checklist-item and checklist
ui: form-modal and modal (a generic form and modal dumb component used by both features)

### [Lesson 5: Creating a Form Modal Component](#lesson-5-creating-a-form-modal-component)

```
handleSubmit(){
  this.save.emit();
  this.close.emit();

  // trigger some other thing here
}
```

The author of StateAdapt, Mike Pearson, describes callback functions like this as:
> The curly braces of functions that donâ€™t return anything are like open arms inviting imperative code.
